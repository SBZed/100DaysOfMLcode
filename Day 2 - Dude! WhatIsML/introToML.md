Today, I attend one Machine Learning Meetup ["Machine Learning from scratch & Linear Regression (Hands-on)"](http://meetu.ps/e/FVXCr/FKNsW/d). It's One of the Best meetups I ever attend. He (Prasant Sahu Sir) cover Machine Learning and then explain Linear regression in depth.


# Seriously dude, What is Machine Learning? 
 - Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
 - It is the ability for computer programs to analyze data, extract information automatically, and learn from it.
 - So, basically, implementing machine learning means creating algorithms which can learn and make predictions on data.
 
 - let's consider three factors which machine/ Computer program can do
         T - Task
                 P - Performance
                 E - Experience
 - What you really really want to do ? ===> Task
     - so the task can be anything like identify Shapes(Supervised Learning), Learn bicycle(Unsupervised Learning), etc.
     - a task can be divided into three categories 
                 1. Classification (Supervised Learning)
                             2. Regression (Supervised Learning)
                             3. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
     - Classification - Input data Categories into two or more classes. 
     - Regression - Predicting Continuously-valued Output
     - Clustering - a set of inputs is to be divided into groups which are not known beforehand
                 - have 
                     1. Pattern Recognization
                     2. Feature Selection
                     3. Dimensionality Reduction
 
 - How to Evaluate Performance of Machine/Computer program ? ==> Performance
     - Like Measuring Accuracy of Program
     - Scikit-learn have the rich set of performance Measure function
     
 - On which basis machine is learning / from where it taking its knowledge ==> Experience
     - From Historical Data
 

 - The Basic Definition you will find in Tom Mitchell's Book "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect  to some class of tasks T  and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
